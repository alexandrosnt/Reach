description: Quick access to common commands.

The Snippets panel in the sidebar gives you quick access to 150+ pre-made shell commands. It's there for those moments when you know what you want to do but can't remember the exact flags.

## Categories

Snippets are organized into 5 categories:

- **Docker** - container management, image operations, compose commands
- **Git** - branching, logging, diffing, stashing
- **Kubernetes** - pod management, deployments, services, logs
- **Terraform** - plan, apply, state management
- **System** - disk usage, memory, network, processes

## Using snippets

You can do two things with a snippet:

- **Copy** - Click the snippet to copy it to your clipboard
- **Insert** - Click the insert button to paste it directly into the active terminal

## Examples

Some of the commands you'll find in there:

- `docker ps` - list running containers
- `git log --oneline` - compact commit history
- `kubectl get pods` - list pods in current namespace
- `terraform plan` - preview infrastructure changes
- `df -h` - disk usage in human-readable format
- `free -m` - memory usage in megabytes
- `netstat -tlnp` - list listening TCP ports with process info

Handy when you use a command once in a while and don't want to look up the man page every time.
