Here's everything you can do without touching the mouse.

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| **Ctrl+T** | New local terminal tab |
| **Ctrl+W** | Close current tab |
| **Ctrl+Tab** | Switch to next tab |
| **Ctrl+Shift+Tab** | Switch to previous tab |
| **Ctrl+,** (Cmd+, on Mac) | Open Settings |
| **Ctrl+Shift+A** | Toggle AI panel |
| **Ctrl+C** | Copy selection (or send interrupt if nothing is selected) |
| **Ctrl+V** | Paste from clipboard |
| **Ctrl+S** | Save file (in file editor) |
| **Escape** | Close modal/dialog |

:::note
These shortcuts work globally in the app. When the terminal is focused, most key input goes straight to the terminal. The shortcuts above use Ctrl modifiers so they don't conflict with normal terminal input.
